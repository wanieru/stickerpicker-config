# stickerpicker-config
- This is a fork of maunium/stickerpicker to use with my other generic web fork. The generic web fork is hosted on github pages, while the web directory is hosted elsewhere.

# Setup
1. Run setup.sh
2. Add directories for each pack within packs, add .pngs to each
3. Optionally: Link to other index.json's within web/index.json, by adding `links: ["https://..../index.json"]`
4. Rebuild the sticker packs by running rebuild.sh
